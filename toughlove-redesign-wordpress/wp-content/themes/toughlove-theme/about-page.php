            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>In 1985 the first TOUGHLOVE® Parent Support Group in NZ was established in Wellington by Valerie Blennerhasset. 
            Valerie set up the “Parent Support using TOUGHLOVE®” Trust after an article in the NZ Herald resulted in over 800 letters of enquiry. 
            Valerie imported materials from the founders of TOUGHLOVE® the York’s in America, and used every opportunity to promote it.</p>
            <p>More Groups were subsequently formed and in 1990 members from 75 Support Groups came together for the inaugural meeting of a 
            formally constituted national body known as TOUGHLOVE® New Zealand incorporated or TLNZ. Eventually ten affiliated regional associations 
            were established to manage delivery of the TOUGHLOVE® Programme across New Zealand.</p>
            <p>In 1993 TLNZ entered into a licensing agreement with Phyllis and the late David York. 
                This authorised TLNZ Inc., to represent TOUGHLOVE® in New Zealand, Australia and the South Pacific.
